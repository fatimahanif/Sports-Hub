# Sports-Hub
Visual Programming semester project

This is my semester project for visual programming. In this project I am developing a desktop application in WPF (.NET Framework) for windows (initially), and later in ASP.NET MVC

This application is for wholesale supply management for a company that manufactures sports equipment

Customers can view and buy products. They can make payments and view their invoice etc. They also have a cart to add products

Similarly, the managers can add, update, remove products and do other management stuff

Suppliers are responsible for on-time delivery of products to the customers

It is an individual project and I really hope it turns out to be good :(

P.S I suck at UI designing, more of a logic and database person, so my GUI is very basic

Languages/Database:

1. C#

2. XAML

3. Microsoft SQL Server
